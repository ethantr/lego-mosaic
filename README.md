# Brick Mosaic Generator
## Overview

The Brick Mosaic Generator is a web application designed to convert any image into a stunning Lego mosaic artwork. Users can upload or drag-and-drop images, adjust the grid size, and generate a mosaic that includes a detailed piece count, allowing you to recreate the design at home.

## Usage

  - Upload an Image: Drag and drop or select an image to start.
  - Adjust the Grid Size: Choose the dimensions of the grid to get your preferred mosaic size.
  - Generate Mosaic: View the pixelated mosaic and check the piece count list to start building with Lego!
  
## How It Works
1. Upload an image or drag and drop it into the app.
2. Select your desired grid size for the mosaic (e.g., 48x48).
3. The app will process the image, pixelate it, and create a mosaic with a piece count.
4. View the generated mosaic and use the instructions to create your own at-home LEGO-inspired artwork.
